The Seabase project is made possible by a grant from the Prince Albert II of Monaco Fondation.</br>
Seasbase is a website using [gage](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/gage), a configuration framework for producing "G"enomic "P"ages.  It wraps [jBrowse 1](https://jbrowse.org/jbrowse1.html) and [SequenceServer](https://sequenceserver.com/) in website generated by a [Jekyl](https://jekyllrb.com/) wrapper.  
A build script faciliates data and metadata validation and staging.
